## About me
After 4 years working in education I've decided to change my proffesion. As an experienced teacher I have strong organizational and communication skills. I always pay great attention to details at work or at home and my analytical and problem solving thinking are also a good basis for a QA tester. I've worked hard and taken steps to develop my technical knowledge and skills. I successfully passed the ISTQB FL exam, done many courses on Udemy and started freelance testing to impove my knowledge in practical way. I belive that testing is perfect field for me and is also starting point to futher development in automation or software development.
